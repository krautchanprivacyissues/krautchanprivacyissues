                <p class="lead">Hello, I am Sebastian, some may know me as internet autist, some as not-completely sane guy, some as cool anon.<br><b>But now I have really something important to tell you.</b><br>

                I would like to warn you about visiting imageboard krautchan.net

                The staff of it really doesn't give a flying *coitus* about your personal data, and shares it with third parties.
<br>
                <p class="small">backstory:somebody found a imageboard which is basically for females - whatever, but among virgins of krautchan it became pretty hot topic.Some of them was thinking about raiding this board etc.And then mods-cucks (there is a meme that they like cuckold) went insane and became banning everybody, checking their IP and probably sharing with other imageboards.
                  I capped this topics in case somebody would delete it.
                As you can see, the next post after moderator's is banned - funny thing - few seconds later, like I would be able to read and delete it in half minture.Not mentioning that's my only post, I wasn't planning to spam this board anyway, because I have better things to do, but I was banned anyway following witch hunt
                But that isn't worst.Prepare for best: </h6>
                </p>
                Ofc I wasn't satisfied with this decision, and I complained about it on IRC as you can see on picrel.
                I asked about my ban, and they, they…Just posted my IP fully visible to public(I cropped the last part on the screencap myself).
                I felt like I would drink few beers despite I am sober.
                Really, I may be oversensitive about privacy - but that's beyond all imagination - sharing your personal data with everybody.

                Following witch hunt I am really concerned - Are moderators of krautchan selling/sharing our IPs to the other imageboards or people with not so good intences?Well, I don't have any that kind of data, but it seems probable.Visiting this board is up to you, but don't cry if something similar will happen with you.
